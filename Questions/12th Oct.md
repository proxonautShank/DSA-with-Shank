##### ðŸš€ Challenge 14 *(Mid-Hard)*
Given a string, your task is to replace each of its characters by the next one in the English alphabet; i.e. replace `a` with `b`, replace `b` with `c`, etc (`z` would be replaced by `a`).

Check if the given string is a correct variable name.
###### Example
- For `inputString = "crazy"`, the output should be `solution(inputString) = "dsbaz"`.
- For `inputString = "big"`, the output should be `solution(inputString) = "cjh"`.

##### ðŸš€ Challenge 15 *(Mid-Easy)*
Given an unsorted integer array, find a pair with the given sum in it.

###### Example
- For `nums = [8, 7, 2, 5, 4, 1]` and `target = 10`, the output should be
`solution(nums) = (8, 2)`.
- For `nums = [8, 7, 2, 5, 3, 1]` and `target = 12`, the output should be
`solution(nums) = (7, 5)`.

###### Solution
```
func solution(n: Int) -> Bool {
    for c in String(n) {
        guard Int(String(c))!%2 == 0 else {return false}
    }
    return true
}
```

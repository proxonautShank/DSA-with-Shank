Given an array of integers, replace all the occurrences of `elemToReplace` with `substitutionElem`.
###### Example
- For `inputArray = [1, 2, 1]`, `elemToReplace = 1`, and `substitutionElem = 3`, the output should be
`solution(inputArray, elemToReplace, substitutionElem) = [3, 2, 3]`.

##### ðŸš€ Challenge 13 *(Easy)*
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the [IPv4 address](keyword://ipv4-address).

Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.

###### Example
- For `inputString = "172.16.254.1"`, the output should be
`solution(inputString) = true`.
- For `inputString = "172.316.254.1"`, the output should be
`solution(inputString) = false`.

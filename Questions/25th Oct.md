##### ðŸš€ Challenge 17 *(Mid-Easy)*
Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

###### Example
- For `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `solution(a, b) = true`.
- For `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [3, 1, 2]`, the output should be `solution(a, b) = false`.

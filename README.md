# Space station🛰 to improve Proxonaut's👩‍🚀 DSA

##### 🚀 Challenge 1 *(Easy)*
Write a function to check whether a given string is [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).
###### Example
- For `inputString = "aabaa"`, the output should be
`solution(inputString) = true`;
- For `inputString = "abac"`, the output should be
`solution(inputString) = false`;
- For `inputString = "a"`, the output should be
`solution(inputString) = true`.

##### 🚀 Challenge 2 *(Mid-Easy)*
Write a function to find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product from an array of integers and return that product.
###### Example
- For `inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3]`, the output should be
`solution(inputArray) = 21`.

`7` and `3` produce the largest product.

##### 🚀 Challenge 3 *(Moderate)*
Below we will define an `n`-interesting polygon. Write a function to find the area of a polygon for a given `n`.

A `1`-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length `1`. An `n`-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the `n - 1`-interesting polygon and appending `1`-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the `1-, 2-, 3- and 4`-interesting polygons in the picture below.

###### Example
- For `n = 2`, the output should be
`solution(n) = 5`;
- For `n = 3`, the output should be
`solution(n) = 13`.

##### 🚀 Challenge 4 *(Moderate)*

One of the famous band group is visiting your city and they required few rooms in hotel. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the band group are quite superstitious, **they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, as well as any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.**
 
 Given a `matrix of integers`, where each value represents the cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable for the band group (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a `0`).

###### Example

```swift
matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2],
          [0, 5, 0, 0],
          [2, 0, 3, 3]]
```
solution is `9`.

###### Sample test

- For
  ```swift
  matrix = [[1, 1, 1, 0], 
            [0, 5, 0, 1], 
            [2, 1, 3, 10]]
  ```
  solution is `9`.
  
- For
  ```swift
  matrix = [[1, 1, 1, 0], 
            [2, 0, 0, 1], 
            [0, 1, 3, 4]]
  ```
  solution is `5`.

```

##### 🚀 Challenge 5 *(Easy)*
Write a function to return an array containing all of its longest strings.

###### Example
- For `inputArray = ["aba", "aa", "ad", "vcd", "aba"]`, the output should be
`solution = ["aba", "vcd", "aba"]`.

###### Sample test
- Input `["abc", "eeee", "abcd", "dcd"]`, output `["eeee", "abcd"]`
- Input `["lbgwyqkry"]`, output `["lbgwyqkry"]`

```
Solution will be posted on 20th July
